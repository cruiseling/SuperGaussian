# SuperGaussian

We provide a *superfast* set of tools for parametric inference in stationary Gaussian processes.

Majority computation of the **R** library [SuperGauss](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperGauss/index.html) is acomplished through these cpp head files.

To use these files, [VectorFFT.h](https://github.com/cruiseling/Convenient-Fast-Fourier-Transformation) and [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) is required.
